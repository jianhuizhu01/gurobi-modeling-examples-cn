    "我们探讨了两种情景。在基本情景中，我们有足够的容量，需要建立三个临时医疗设施。而在另一种情景（情景1）中，随着需要住院的新冠患者数量增加20%，我们需要建立九个临时医疗设施，并在其中两个增加额外容量。\n",
    "\n",
    "我们的新冠疫情医疗设施选址优化模型可以帮助公共卫生官员和医疗机构在新冠疫情期间做出关于何时何地增加医疗设施容量的战略决策。此外，这个战略模型可以为一个新冠负载平衡调度模型提供信息，该模型能够（实时）将需要住院的新冠患者分配到“合适”的医疗设施。\n",

    "此外，我们的模型可以为一个战术模型提供信息，该模型确定如何增加容量以应对需求的增加。例如，雇用、培训和重新技能化的医疗人员数量，医疗人员的轮换，以及所需设备（如呼吸机、药物、床位等）的数量。"
